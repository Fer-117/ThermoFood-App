# ThermoFood-App
This project focuses on helping people control their weight by selecting healthy recipes that are appropriate for the current weather. Using two APIs, one for recipes and the other for obtaining the current temperature using geolocation, the application provides options for light and fresh meals on hot days and options for more caloric meals on cold days.
